## Project Description

This project combines document processing, embeddings, chatbot capabilities, and intelligent retrieval to facilitate meaningful interactions with documents, enabling efficient analysis and insights. The steps are : 

-- Extract text from documents.
-- Split documents into manageable chunks.
-- download Hugging Face and Sentence Transformer embeddings.
-- Utilize Chroma as the vector database.
-- Download the Llama 2 7B chat model.
-- Create a Hugging Face pipeline for interaction.
-- Create a memory object to track inputs and outputs during conversations.
-- Implement a Conversation Retrieval QA Chain for context-aware replies.
